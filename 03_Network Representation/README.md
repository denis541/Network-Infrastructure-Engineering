## 🏗️ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the architectural design and configuration of a **Small-to-Medium Business (SMB) Network**. The implementation focuses on establishing a scalable, resilient foundation for enterprise communication using industry-standard Cisco hardware and protocols.

## 🛠️ Technical Objectives
- **Architecture Design**: Developing a hierarchical network topology following Cisco best practices.
- **Component Configuration**: End-to-end provisioning of routers, switches, and endpoint devices.
- **Protocol Implementation**: Ensuring reliable data delivery and inter-network communication.
- **Security Baseline**: Initial hardening of network devices to protect the management plane.

## 🔍 Engineering Workflow
1. **Topology Mapping**: Logical and physical design of the business environment.
2. **IP Addressing Schema**: Strategic allocation of subnets to ensure efficient address space utilization.
3. **Connectivity Validation**: Systematic testing of the OSI layers to verify end-to-end reachability.

## 📁 Artifacts
- **[Lab_File.pka](./Network_Infrastructure.pka)**: The source Packet Tracer architecture.
- **[Configuration_Logs.txt](./configs.txt)**: Raw CLI exports for review.
